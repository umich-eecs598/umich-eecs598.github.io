## Expected Report Format
{: #report-format }

**Student teams in DeepRob should complete a written report documenting their paper reproduction and algorithmic extension as part of the final project.** The project report should include the following sections: a paper abstract, an introduction, a related work section, a section describing your algorithmic extension, your experimental setup and results, and finally a conclusion. Final reports are expected to be 4-6 pages, not including references. **Students are expected to typeset their reviews using LaTeX in IEEE conference style.** A [LaTeX report template]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/projects/DeepRobProjectReport.zip) is provided for your convenience. You may write your review collaboratively using online LaTeX tools, such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

**The written report is due Monday, April 28th by 11:59PM EST.**
Students in DeepRob should submit the following under Canvas "Final Project" assignment:
1. An IEEE-style written report (with related work, algorithmic reproduction and extension method descriptions and results).
2. Link to codes/datasets. This can be included as a section in your written report.
