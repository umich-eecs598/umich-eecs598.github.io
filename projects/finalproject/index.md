# Final Project

## Overview

The objective of this project is to build skills needed to understand and lead research projects in deep learning for robot perception. In this project you will read state of the art deep learning papers, reproduce results from an existing paper and finally propose then develop an extension to the existing results.

### The goals for this project are as follows:
 - Practice reading deep learning papers in your areas of interest.
 - Analyze the published motivations, results, and methodologies in deep learning papers from the perspective of a roboticist.
 - Propose an algorithmic extension to a state of the art deep learning model applied to robotic perception.
 - Present your proposed project, clearly motivating how it is relevant to robotic perception.
 - Practice reproducing the results of published work. Build an understanding of what challenges are common when reproducing published results.
 - Document the results of your work in a scholarly format so that they can be shared with peers and move the field forward.
